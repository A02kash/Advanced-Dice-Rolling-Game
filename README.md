# ðŸŽ² Dice Rolling Game

Welcome to the Dice Rolling Game! This project is part of the **FIT9136 Algorithms and Programming Foundations in Python** course, where you'll design, construct, test, and document a Python program to simulate a dice-rolling game.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

This game allows a player to roll between 2 and 6 dice of various types, aiming to achieve a victory by matching the median value of the dice rolls with the mean value. The game includes features such as a main menu, game history, and win/lose checking.
